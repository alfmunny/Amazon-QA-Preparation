Amazon would like to know how much inventory existes in their closed inventory compartments. 
Given a string s consisting of items as "*" and closed compartments as an open an close "|", an array of starting indices startindices,
and an array of ending indices endindices, determine the number of items in closed compartments within the substring between the two indices, inclusive.

* An item is represented as an asterisk('*' = ascii decimal 42)
* A compartment is represented as a pair of pipes that may or may not have items betwwen them('|' = ascii decimal 124)

Example
s = '|**|*|*'

startIndices = [1, 1]
endIndices = [5, 6]
```
